# A simple Node.js server

This project shows a minimal server created only with Node.js. It includes:

 - serving some static files,
 - an API endpoint that receive data, process it and pass it back.


## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://simple-js-server-leojpod.c9users.io/'.
